You should not see this. This scene is displayed when we want the story
to disappear from the screen. It is also the root scene, so when any other
scene is finished, Dendry with return to this scene and remove the story
window.

If you see this appear in your game, you're probably playing this
without its remaining code, so you won't be able to do anything.
