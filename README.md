![Dendry](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dendry/dendry/master/design/logo_64.png) Dendry Samples
======

This repository is intended to contain sample games demonstrating the
functionality of Dendry and a range of different approaches to using
it in a game. They require Dendry to run. Dendry can be found at:
[https://github.com/dendry/dendry](https://github.com/dendry/dendry).

Typically each game can be played on the command line with

    $ dendry run tutorial

or built into one of its supported playable formats using the
approprite `make-` command, e.g.

    $ dendry make-html tutorial

(both commands assume you have dendry on your path). It can then be
run or viewed, e.g.

    $ google-chrome tutorial/out/html/index.html

Consult the README file for each game for more details or special
instructions.
